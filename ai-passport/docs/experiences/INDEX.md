# Development Experience Archive Index

This page lists every recorded development experience entry under
[`docs/experiences/`](../development/experience-notes.md), grouped by the
contributing developer's GitHub username. Each entry is a reusable,
post-release learning, and its records are written and indexed by the
`experience-pr` skill.

For how to add an entry and what belongs here, see the
[experience notes index](../development/experience-notes.md).

## Index

Each entry is stored under `docs/experiences/<username>/` and listed here grouped
by the contributing developer's username. A developer may have **one or more
entries**; each is its own record, and a new learning is added as a new entry
rather than merged into an existing one.

- [Audio Compression Trade-offs on ESP32-C3](shinku-chen/audio-compression-trade-offs.md) — how a voice-playback codec was chosen on limited flash (IMA-ADPCM vs Opus vs MP3), with measured capacity and decoder cost.
- [Post-Release Follow-up for the AI Passport Publishing Flow](shinku-chen/post-release-follow-up.md) — confirm the publish destination, include the data partition in a release, and the consent gates for the post-release tracks.
- [Display Refresh and Deep-sleep on ESP32-C3 (No PSRAM)](shinku-chen/display-refresh-and-deep-sleep.md) — direct panel refresh of a single image rect, RTC-GPIO deep-sleep wakeup, and the LVGL object-type misuse crash signature.
